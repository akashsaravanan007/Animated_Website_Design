                A fishery is an area with an associated fish or aquatic population which is harvested for its commercial value.
                 Fisheries can be wild or farmed. Most of the world's wild fisheries are in the ocean. This article is an
                  overview of ocean fisheries.

            <h2>The fish of the deep sea</h2>
            <p>
                In the nutrient-rich and highly productive coastal regions, massive reproduction is typical of many species, 
                and this ensures their survival. Many deep-sea fish species, on the other hand, are characterized by slow growth,
                 late sexual maturity, long life, and the production of fewer offspring. They are adapted to life at great depths,
                  to a habitat in which unchanging environmental conditions prevail. The strong temperature fluctuations that can
                   impact the reproduction of fish in shallow coastal regions are absent here.
            </p>
            <h2>Fisheries in the deep sea</h2>
            <p>
                Commercial fishing has only been carried out in deep waters over the past few decades. Although longline fishing has
                been practised since the 18th century, industrial fishing far out in the ocean first became practicable in the 1950s
                with the availability of seaworthy refrigeration ships. Deep-sea fishing received a boost in the early 1970s with the
                introduction of the 200-nautical-mile zone, or Exclusive Economic Zone, which made it impossible for foreign ships
                to fish close to the coasts of another country. The high seas, including the deep sea, were an alternative fishing
                area.

                         Often marked by lines and spots, they inhabit tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the world,
                          with the greatest species richness in the Indo-Pacific.</td>

                    <td style="text-align:justify">Triggerfish get their name from spines on the dorsal (back) fins that can be used as a predator
                         defense and for anchoring.Triggerfish is not limited in flavor. The clean white meat that tastes
                          similar to sweet crab meat when cooked will bring a lot of depth and flavor to your fish recipes.
                          Triggerfish might be tricky to catch, but the fight is well worth it. These fish are some

                          which often stretches the entire length of the back.Sailfish are the fastest fish in the ocean.

                         or eaten raw as in sashimi. Sailfish and spearfish are somewhat tough and are better cooked over
                          charcoal or smoked.Although there are no reports of unprovoked attacks on humans, swordfish can
                           be very dangerous when provoked and they can jump and use their swords to pierce their target.
                           These fishes are very hard to catch because they are just so damn fast and powerful!.</td>

                         Dogtooth Tuna belong to the Mackerel family instead of the tunas. Definatley great eating. Lots of meat 
                         on them too. Sashimi, BBQ's, pan fried, cerviche, and damn good smoked too. One reason their appetites 
                         are so insatiable is their unusual circulatory system.</td>
